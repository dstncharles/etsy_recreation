These beautiful NFL inspired garters are handmade with ivory, red, and blue chiffon shabby flowers, a team logo charm, sparkly rhinestones, and pretty 1 1\/2&quot; light ivory\/off white stretch lace. Perfect for your special day!\r\n\r\nAll bridal garters are ready to ship in 1-2 days via USPS Priority Mail and come in a gift box\u2665\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: The stretch lace used for this garter is not traditional elastic, therefore it is not as stretchable as a traditional garter. Body tape is included for extra support to help prevent a wardrobe malfunction.\r\n\r\n*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*\r\n\r\nHOW TO TAKE YOUR THIGH MEASUREMENT:\r\n\r\nMeasure where you would like to wear your main keepsake garter, usually 5-6 inches above the knee.\r\n\r\nUse a soft measuring tape around the spot you want to wear your keepsake garter. If you don&#39;t have a soft measuring tape, use a string to measure and then hold the string against a ruler to get the measurement.\r\n\r\nTake your exact thigh measurement, making sure not to pull the tape or string too tight. Do not take off any inches, I will deduct the necessary amount. Each garter is made to fit your chosen size, so please measure carefully to ensure a proper fit. \r\n\r\n*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*&quot;*\r\n\r\nQUALITY PROMISE - Bridal garters are handmade using the finest quality flowers, crystals, charms, and lace.
